Description:
Swift Transfer Car Booking App is a user-friendly web application built with Flask and Bootstrap. Seamlessly book your car by providing essential details such as your name, pickup, and drop-off locations, date, time, and contact number. After submitting the form, you'll receive a confirmation message, assuring your booking is confirmed. Our team will reach out to you soon, ensuring a swift and convenient travel experience. 
In summary, this code creates a basic Flask web application with two routes: one for entering user details and another for displaying a confirmation page. The application utilizes HTML templates ('index.html' and 'confirmation.html') for rendering the respective pages. User input from a form on the index page is processed when submitted via a POST request, and the details are printed before redirecting to a confirmation page. The application runs in debug mode when executed as the main script.
